## Description
This project aims to create a system that identifies patient conditions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By automating the classification of patient conditions based on drug reviews, we can help reduce the workload for healthcare professionals and facilitate early evaluation of patient types.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Drug Review Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29) that is my google drive link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g4_sN30W54Z7XFpwOoaHIDewl44AR7tB/view?usp=sharing.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and visualizations of the data to uncover trends and patterns.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Stop Word Removal
2. Lemmatization
3. Dataset Splitting
   - Split the dataset into an 80% training set and a 20% test set.
4. Feature and Target Variable Creation

## Model
1. **TF-IDF**: A popular technique for converting text data into numerical vectors for ML models.
2. **Bag of Words**
3. **Naive Bayes**
4. **Passive Aggressive Classifier**

## Evaluation
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Accuracy Metrics

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and help improve our understanding of patient conditions through data-driven insights!!
